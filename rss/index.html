This is a prototype podcast for of the videos for {course}. Podcasting
has a couple of advantages for viewing the videos. You can watch the
videos from virtually any device, including your phone when
commuting. In addition, if you subscribe to multiple podcasts, you can
automatically view things when they are available, rather than
checking each source individually.

As an engineering prototype, we can make no guarantees on whether this
will continue to work. Whether we decide to launch it in other courses
will be based, in part, on your experience and feedback.

If you need them, we have included instructions for how to install
this podcast on several devices. We're not endorsing the particular
applications; they just happened to be the first ones that worked for
us.
